<h3 class="blog-title">My HTML Experience</h3>
<p class="blog-content">I've had former experiences with coding in HTML. When I was in middle school, I was bored on my computer and came across web development. I was feeling creative, and wanted to do something new, so I went through some HTML tutorials, and learned the basics of creating a basic website. Learning to code in HTML led to me learning other languages such as Python and C++. Web development has been a large part of my life, and helped me meet new friends that shared the same enthusiasm for creating. I've worked in groups, and made passion projects with people from all across the world, which ultimately helped me decide what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I wanted to be a programmer, and I knew that learning on my own was a great step to making programming a career.</p>

<h3 class="blog-title">What I've Learned In College</h3>
<p class="blog-content">I'm a senior at MSU studying Computer Science. Over the past few years studying a lot, I've learned many things about my future career, and learned the skills needed to pursue the career i've wanted for years. One thing i've learned is to not procrastinate. I must admit I do procrastinate still, but when I work on projects and homework much earlier, I noticed that my grades were a lot better, than If i were to just wait until the last minute. I do still find it difficult to not procrastinate, like many students, which has been a problem for me that I wish to fix.</p>
