<h3 class="blog-title">My HTML Experience</h3>
<p class="blog-content">I've had former experiences with coding in HTML. When I was in middle school, I was bored on my computer and came across web development. I was feeling creative, and wanted to do something new, so I went through some HTML tutorials, and learned the basics of creating a basic website. Learning to code in HTML led to me learning other languages such as Python and C++.</p>
