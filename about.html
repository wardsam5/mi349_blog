			I've been into computers and building computers since I was around 14 years old. I saved up money to buy my first pre built desktop computer when I was 14, and later upgraded the computer with parts I bought to make it faster. When I was around 17 years old, I bought all the parts to build my first new computer from scratch. I learned how annoying it was to build, and debug issues that prevented my computer from running correctly. My 2nd time building a new computer was when I got my first job when I was 19. I put a lot of money into the parts, and it was my first real computer I used to play games on my PC.
